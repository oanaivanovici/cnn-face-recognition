This repository contains experimentations using Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks,  utilising Keras. 
The AlexNet CNN was implemented from scratch, layers were tweaked for improved performance, and the network was trained with available data. 
On the other hand, InceptionV3 and VGG16 were used directly off Keras to experiment with transfer learning. Extra layers were added on top of the networks, which were trained with available data, while the existing original network parameters were maintained. The performance was compared against a fully trained AlexNet.
